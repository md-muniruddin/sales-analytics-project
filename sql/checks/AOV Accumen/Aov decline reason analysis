The question we are answering (reframed correctly)

“WHAT changed in demand that caused AOV to decline?”

This is not asking for a chart.
This is asking for a mechanism.

AOV declines only if the composition of orders changes.
There are exactly four levers that can do that. No more.

The ONLY 4 things worth drilling into (ranked)
1️⃣ Product mix (highest signal, first stop)

Question

Are customers buying cheaper products more often than before?

This means:

Low-ticket categories gaining share

High-ticket categories growing slower or stagnating

Why this is first

Most common cause

Already consistent with everything you’ve seen

Directly explains AOV without breaking any other metric

What to drill

Category share of revenue over time

Category-level AOV vs portfolio AOV

If low-AOV categories take more share → AOV falls.
No mystery.

2️⃣ Customer mix (second, only if needed)

Question

    Are different types of customers placing orders?

Typical pattern:

    New customers ↑

    Repeat customers stable

    New customers have lower AOV

This is extremely common in marketplace growth phases.

What to drill

    New vs repeat order share over time

    AOV of new vs repeat customers

    If new-customer share rises → AOV falls naturally.

Pattern A — Customer mix explains AOV decline
    Share of new customer orders ↑
    AOV_new < AOV_repeat
    Portfolio AOV trends downward
    → Customer mix is a primary or co-primary driver
Pattern B — Customer mix does NOT explain AOV decline
    New/repeat share stable
    OR AOV_new ≈ AOV_repeat
    OR repeat customers dominate revenue
    → Customer mix is not the cause
Stop immediately if Pattern B holds.

3️⃣ Basket composition (within-order behavior)

This is more subtle and often ignored.

Question

    Are orders getting “thinner”?

Examples:

    Fewer items per order

    Fewer add-ons

    Loss of cross-sell

Even if:

    Categories stay the same

    Customers stay the same

    AOV can fall if baskets shrink.

What to drill

    Items per order (weekly)

    Revenue per item

T   his is a secondary drill, not primary.

4️⃣ Geographic expansion (only if business context supports it)

Question

    Did demand expand into lower-purchasing-power regions?

This causes:

    More orders

    Lower average spend

    But this only matters if:

    The business actually expanded geographically

Case A — Geography matters

You’ll see:
    Order growth concentrated in:
    Smaller states
    Less affluent regions
    These states have lower AOV
    Portfolio AOV declines
Conclusion
    “Demand expansion into lower-AOV regions contributed to the AOV decline.”
This becomes a secondary or tertiary driver, never primary (product mix already won).
Case B — Geography does NOT matter
You’ll see:
    Top states (e.g., SP, RJ) still dominate
    Their AOVs are at or above portfolio
    Growth proportional across regions
Conclusion
    “Geographic expansion did not materially impact AOV.”
This is a clean elimination, not a failure.
Otherwise, it’s speculative.
